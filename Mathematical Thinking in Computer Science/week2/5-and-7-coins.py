# Recursion: pay any large amount with 5- and 7-coins.
# 
# Develop a Python method change(amount)
# that for any integer amount in the range from 24 to 1000 returns a list consisting of numbers 5 and 7 only,
# such that their sum is equal to amount.
# For example, change(28) may return [7, 7, 7, 7],
# while change(49) may return [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7] or [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7] or [7, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7].

def change(amount):
  assert(amount >= 24)
  if amount == 24:
    return [5, 5, 7, 7]
  if amount == 25:
    return [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
  if amount == 26:
    return [5, 7, 7, 7]
  if amount == 27:
    return [5, 5, 5, 5, 7]
  if amount == 28:
    return [7, 7, 7, 7]

  coins = change(amount-5)
  coins.append(5)
  return coins
